Intent-Based Chatbot using Python and Machine Learning
This project is a simple, intent-based chatbot built with Python that uses TF-IDF vectorization and a Logistic Regression model to classify user inputs into predefined intents and generate appropriate responses.

✅ Features
-->Machine Learning-based intent classification
-->Clean and modular code structure
-->Easy to expand with new intents and responses
-->Runs in the terminal

📁 Project Structure

├── chatbot.py         # Main chatbot logic
├── train.py           # Model training script
├── intents.json       # Intent definitions (patterns & responses)
├── model.pkl          # Trained model (generated after training)

🚀 Getting Started
1. Install Dependencies
   -->pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Train the Model
   -->python train.py
This generates the model.pkl file required for the chatbot to run.
3. Start the Chatbot
   -->python chatbot.py

💬 Example Questions to Try
-What are your hours?  
-Who are you?  
-Thanks  
-Bye  
-Type "quit" to exit the chatbot.

🛠 How to Add New Intents
 -->Open intents.json.
 -->Add new tag, patterns, and responses.
 -->Re-run train.py to retrain the model.

🌟 Future Improvements
-->Integration with RASA NLU for advanced intent detection
-->Entity extraction for more dynamic conversations
-->Connect to web or messaging platforms

📌 Ideal For
-->Understanding basic chatbot architecture
-->Practicing ML-based intent classification
